<p>Shout out to <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone">@jmcglone</a> for the killer <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">documentation</a> helping me finally put my 1st site together. Thanks for your awesome documentation.  This site is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I use Markdown to author my posts. I recommend it and look forward to building this site further soon!</p>
