<p>Sheesh, it’s been such a long time since I posted anything to this site. This year I’m making professional growth and explanation of what I do exactly during my days a priority. Being a Geospatial Developer isn’t exactly the most recognizable occupation one can have. I look forward to sharing bits and pieces of my everyday professional journey from now on and hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to a great year. Talk to you soon from Washashore Island.</p>
